Features

1. Setting and getting properties in the viewer rather than parameters in the setting functions
2. Exploring a good coefficient for GL

4. Draw principal directions in 305 in different colors to min/max
5. Changing saved data to another folder

Bugs

1. When scaling vector lengths, it pops to the non-prescribed value
2. Fix streamlines stopping
3. Empty GUI box opens with a callback.
4. Setting several fields with the same name to the same number adds them up.
5. Check I'm not looking at absolute values in scalar field visualization when not needed
6. Check 305 again, perhaps on a better mesh
7. highlight_vertices doesn't really work with boundaries
