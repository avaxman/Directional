Features

1. Setting and getting properties in the viewer rather than parameters in the setting functions
2. Exploring a good coefficient for GL
3. Be verbose in the projection functions as well
4. Draw principal directions in 305 in different colors to min/max

Backend

1. Remove the normalization option from power_to_raw (should be a pure conversion method)
2. Correct assertions


Bugs

1. When scaling vector lengths, it pops to the non-prescribed value
2. Fix streamlines stopping
5. Check I'm not looking at absolute values in scalar field visualization when not needed
6. Check 305 again, perhaps on a better mesh
7. highlight_vertices doesn't really work with boundaries
