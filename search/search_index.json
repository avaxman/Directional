The functionality is based on the definitions and taxonomy surveyed theoretically in [Vaxman et al. 2016] and [de Goes et al. 2016], and in many newer papers in the literature, cited within context in this tutorial and the code. Directional contains tools to edit, analyze, and visualize directional fields of various degrees, orders, and symmetries.</p> <p>Discretization in Directional is abstracted by general discrete tangent bundles that can represent a rich class of directional fields. As a result, many of the library\u2019s algorithms can now work seamlessly on multiple representations without modification (for example, power fields can be computed on either vertex-based or face-based fields using the same function). The library comprises two basic elements:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Classes representing the basic tangent bundle and field structures. They are built with inheritance so that    functions can be written polymorphically and consequently algorithms can be applied to several representations that have the minimal set of required properties.</p> </li> <li> <p>Standalone functions, implementing directional-field algorithms, that take these classes as parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Algebraic structures, such as cochain complexes. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Our paradigm avoids buffed classes with a complicated nested hierarchy; instead, the member functions in the classes are minimal, and only used to implement the essential properties of a geometric object (for instance, the connection between tangent spaces).

For the most part, one header contains only one function. The atomic data structures are, for the most part, simple matrices in Eigen, The visualization is done through a specialized class <code>DirectionalViewer</code>, which is a wrapper around PolyScope, with many extended options that facilitate the rendering of directional fields.</p> <p>The header files contain documentation of the parameters to each function and their required composition; in this tutorial, we mostly tie the functionality of Directional to the theoretical concepts of directional fields and the methods to process and visualize them.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#installing-the-tutorial-examples","title":"Installing the tutorial examples","text":"<p>This tutorial comprises an exhaustive set of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of Directional, where every subchapter entails a single concept.

The set of all such tangent spaces is called a tangent bundle. </p> <p>In the discrete setting, a tangent bundle is a finite graph G_{TB} = (V_{TB},E_{TB}) of tangent spaces. Each tangent space is an independent vector space of dimension d. This concept is implemented in the class <code>TangentBundle</code>. Discrete tangent bundles supply one or more of the following properties:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Intrinsic parameterization: vectors in a single tangent space are represented with coordinates \\left(x_1,\\cdots,x_d\\right) in an arbitrary, but fixed basis of dimension d. The basis itself does not need to be specified for many algorithms; it can stay abstract.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjacency: a tangent bundle is represented as a graph where the tangent spaces are nodes, and the graph edges are adjacency relations that encode the local environment of any tangent space. This, in fact, encodes the combinatorial and topological structure of the underlying discrete manifold, akin to the smooth structure in the continuum.</p> </li> <li> <p>Connection: a connection defines the notion of parallelity in two adjacent tangent spaces, which encodes a metric structure on the underlying manifold, and allows for computing derivatives and curvature. Specifically, a connection is a directed-edge-based quantity on the tangent-bundle graph, given as a change of coordinates between the bases of the source tangent space to the target tangent space. This can be represented as an orthogonal matrix.</p> </li> <li> <p>metric The metric on the bundle is supplied in two quantities: <code>connectionMass</code> is the weight of each edge E_{TB}, and <code>tangentSpaceMass</code> packs the weights of an inner product on vectors on the bundle. That is, it has either V_{TB} or V_{TB}+E_{TB} that are the non-zero components of the vector mass matrix.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cycles: G_{TB} can be equipped with a notion of cycles F_{TB} that are simply-connected closed chains of spaces. Given a connection, the holonomy of a cycle is the failure of a vector to return to itself following a set of parallel transports around the cycle. Concretely, it is encoded in the logarithm of the product of connection matrices. In d=2, holonomy, which is then a single angle, is equivalent to the curvature of the cycle modulo 2\\pi. There are two types of cycles, which define the topology of the underlying manifold: local cycles (akin to \u201cfaces\u201d in G_{TB}), which are small closed loops, and global cycles, which can be homological generators and boundary loops. The singularities of fields are defined on the local cycles.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Oftentimes, the above intrinsic quantities are enough for all algorithms; nevertheless, for reasons of input, output, and visualization, a <code>TangentBundle</code> will contain the following, embedding-based extrinsic quantities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sources and normals: point locations and their normals (the codimensional directions of the manifold), which define the tangent planes of the manifold in the Euclidean space. Note that this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a watertight mesh; that could also encode a point cloud, for instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>extrinsic to intrinsic and back: functionality that projects extrinsic vectors into intrinsic space (might lose information), or produces the extrinsic representation of an intrinsic directional object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cycles sources and normals. Like sources and normals, but for the cycles themselves. These quantities mark the locations of the singularities in space, for visualization purposes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Two main types are currently implemented in directional: <code>PCFaceTangentBundle</code> implements face-based tangent spaces for 2D triangle meshes, where the fields are tangent to the natural plane supporting the triangles. <code>IntrinsicVertexTangentBundle</code> implements vertex-based intrinsic tangent spaces, which parameterize the cone environment of the 1-ring directly[^Knoeppel_2013]</p> <p>For example, this is how <code>PCFaceTangentBundle</code> implements the above quantities:</p> <ol> <li>Intrinsic parameterization: a local basis in every face.</li> <li>Adjacency: dual (inner) edges between any two faces.</li> <li>Connection: the rotation matrix between the bases of any two adjacent faces.</li> <li>Cycles: the local cycles are around vertex 1-rings, where singularities are then defined as (dual) vertex values, and global cycles are dual loops of generators and boundaries.</li> <li>Inner product: the natural face-based mass matrix (just a diagonal matrix of face areas).</li> <li>Sources are face barycenters, and normals are just face normals.</li> <li>The projection to the supporting plane of the face and encoding in local coordinates.</li> <li>Vertices and vertex normals (area-weighted from adjacent faces) are the cycle quantities.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the choices above can be varied to different flavors of face-based fields (for instance, the metric culminating in the mass weights). <code>PCFaceTangentBundle</code> wraps around a an orientable input triangle mesh in a single connected-component. There are no other limitations on its genus or boundaries. If your input comprises several connected components altogether, you should use several tangent bundles.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#representation","title":"Representation","text":"<p>The representation of a directional field is its encoding in each discrete tangent plane. The most important element is the number of vectors in each tangent plane, which we denote as the degree of the field N. Currently, Directional supports fields that are represented by explicit (intrinsic) coordinates, which we call a cartesian field, and are represented by the class <code>CartesianField</code>. Directional currently supports the following variants of Cartesian fields [Vaxman et al. 2016].</p> <ol> <li>Raw - a vector of d\\times N entries represents an intrinsic 1^N-vector (a directional with N independent vectors in each tangent space) in dimension-dominant ordering: (X_{1,1},\\ldots, X_{1,d}),(X_{1,2},\\ldots,X_{2,d}),\\ldots (X_{N,1},\\ldots, X_{N,d}) per space (for instance, for d=3 and N=4 it would be xyzxyzxyzxyz ordering with 12 components per tangent space). Vectors are assumed to be ordered in counterclockwise order in most Directional functions that process raw fields. the memory complexity is then dN|V_{TB}| for the entire directional field. A Cartesian Field indicates being a raw field by setting <code>CartesianField::fieldType</code> to <code>directional::RAW_FIELD</code>.</li> <li>Power Field - This is a unique type to d=2. It encodes an N-rotational-symmetric (N-RoSy) object as a single complex number y=u^N relative to the local basis in the tangent space, where the N-RoSy is the set of roots u \\cdot e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{N}}, k \\in [0,N-1]. The magnitude is also encoded this way, though it may be neglected in some applications. The memory complexity is then 2|V_{TB}|.</li> <li>PolyVector - Also unique to d=2, this is a generalization of power fields that represents an N-directional object in a tangent space as the coefficients a of a monic complex polynomial f(z)=z^N+\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}{a_iz^i}, which roots u are the encoded 1^N-vector field. In the case where the field is an N-RoSy, all coefficients but a_0 are zero. Note: A PolyVector that represents a perfect N-RoSy would have all a_i=0,\\ \\forall i&gt;0, but a_0 would have the opposite sign from the power-field representation of the same N-RoSy. This is since the power field represents u^N directly, whereas a PolyVector represents the coefficients of z^N-u^N in this case. The memory complexity is 2N|V_{TB}|.</li> </ol> <p>Directional provides a number of conversion functions to switch between different representations. Each of the functions is of the form <code>rep1_to_rep2</code>, where <code>rep1</code> and <code>rep2</code> are the representation names in the above list. e.g., <code>polyvector_to_raw()</code>. Some possible combinations are given by composing two functions in sequence. However, note that not every conversion is possible; for instance, it is not possible to convert from PolyVectors to power fields, as they do not possess the same power of expression. Converting into the more explicit raw representation is often needed for I/O and visualization, but not only.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#chapter-1-io-and-visualization","title":"Chapter 1: I/O and Visualization","text":""},{"location":"tutorial/#visualization-paradigm","title":"Visualization paradigm","text":"<p>Directional uses a specialized class called <code>directional::DirectionalViewer</code> which wraps around <code>PolyScope</code>, augmenting it with functionality that pertains to directional fields.

Note that this can also include multiple full rotations (i.e., this is not taken modulo N), where the index can be unbounded. The fractional part of the index is encoded by the matching; however, matching alone cannot encode integral indices (for instance, a single vector field has trivial (Zero) matching anywhere, but can have singularities).

These are special cases of the more abstract algebraic notion of cochain complexes. Without going into the full formality, such a complex is defined by a series of spaces \\Omega_i,  0 \\leq i \\leq d, for some dimension d, which are related by differential operators d_i:\\Omega_i\\rightarrow \\Omega_{i+1}. These spaces can be equipped with a metric &lt;&gt;_i:\\Omega_i \\times \\Omega_i \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+}. Essential to the definition is that d_{i+1}d_i=0. For instance, scalars to vectors by the gradient operator, and then vectors to scalars (in 2D) by the curl operators comprise a cochain complex. A cochain complex also defines i^{th} singular cohomologies, which are the quotient spaces \\mathbb{H}_{i}=ker(d_{i})/im(d_{i-1}). These only arise in case of nontrivial topology, and |\\mathbb{H}_i|=\\beta_i are called the Betti numbers, which are in fact generators of the topology. The fields in these spaces are called harmonic. The metric also defines a Hodge star \\star_i: \\Omega_i\\rightarrow\\Omega_{d-i}, which is a duality relation; that often defines a dual cochain with a codifferential operator \\delta_i = (-1)^i\\star_i^{-1}d_i^T\\star_{i+1}.</p> <p>Example: All gradient fields are curl free, but there are only curl-free fields that are not also gradient in topologies like annuli or tori. the torus has genus 1 and admits two harmonic fields.</p> <p>In the discrete setting, the spaces are represented as arrays of nodal values in some finite space, the d operators are (often sparse) matrices, and the metrics are implemented as symmetric positive matrices M so that &lt;a,b&gt;_i = a^TM_ib.
